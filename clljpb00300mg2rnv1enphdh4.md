Another week, another newsletter. Let's get to it!

Around the Web
--------------

*   [Introducing the Enhanced Monorepo Experience on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/better-monorepos-on-netlify/?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696) – The enhanced monorepo support that landed recently on Netlify is impressive. I had a chance to dogfood it and provide feedback as it was being iterated on. Hat tip to my co-worker [Lukas Holzer](https://www.netlify.com/blog/authors/lukas-holzer/?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696) on this one.
*   [Fresh 1.4](https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.4?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696) just landed with faster page loads, layouts and more! Marvin has been on fire since becoming a maintainer for Fresh. Fantastic to see all this goodness!
*   [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696) – If you're a fan of Tailwind, or even if you aren't this project seems pretty compelling for React Native developers.
    
    > NativeWind uses Tailwind CSS as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native. NativeWind components can be shared between platforms and will output their styles as CSS StyleSheet on web and StyleSheet.create for native.
    
    [Hat tip to Ricky for the share](https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii/status/1691599894249623948?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696).
    

Fun Stuff

This is my own fun stuff this week. I got to see all kinds of [whales on my trip to Newfoundland](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwDwH6zAFO4/?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696)!

Words of Wisdom for the Week
----------------------------

> "How do you stay on track with your own growth in a fast-paced, startup environment?"

Some great [knowledge nuggets from Kevin Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090000034963881984/?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696), a.k.a. KBall on this question.

Shameless Plugs
---------------

There was no nickyt.live this week as I was off, but there's a good one coming up next week with Brian Douglas.

[![nickyt.live promo for guest Brian Douglas](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692551232560/98b3393c-4a6f-4885-8b0d-840dee1826b0.jpeg)](https://www.nickyt.co/pages/stream-schedule/?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696#brian-douglas-pizza-bake-off-)

We’ll discuss the [pizza project](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696), a Go micro-service that sources git commits from any arbitrary git repo and indexes them into a postgres database.

With a bit of downtime in the evening while on vacation, I put out this short guide to [debugging Firefox add-ons](https://dev.to/nickytonline/how-to-debug-a-firefox-add-on-extension-489f?utm_source=nickytonline&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=yet-another-newsletter-lol-so-fresh-3696) (extensions). If you’re an extension developer or aspiring one, maybe you’ll find it helpful.
