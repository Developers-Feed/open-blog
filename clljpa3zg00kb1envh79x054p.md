yo wassup flutter devs!!

Flutter apps make over 1 billion API calls per day, connecting to a wide variety of services.

From fetching weather data to retrieving user profiles, APIs are the backbone of many Flutter apps.

If you're not tapping into this power, you're missing out!

* * *

Introduction
------------

In today's digital age, data is the new gold. And how do we access this gold?

Through APIs! With Flutter's incredible UI capabilities and the power of APIs, you can create dynamic, data-driven apps that provide real-time information to your users.

In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process of connecting your Flutter app to a REST API, ensuring you can fetch, display, and manipulate data seamlessly.

What is a REST API?
-------------------

Before diving into the code, let's understand what a REST API is. Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

In simpler terms, it's a way for your app to communicate with a server, fetch data, and update data.

* * *

Setting Up Your Flutter App
---------------------------

1) **Create a New Flutter App**  

       flutter create api_flutter_app
    

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

2) **Add Dependencies**  
Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:  

       dependencies:
         flutter:
           sdk: flutter
         http: ^0.13.3
    

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

3) **Fetch the Packages**  

       flutter pub get
    

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

* * *

Connecting to the API
---------------------

4) **Import the Required Packages**  

       import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
       import 'dart:convert';
    

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

5) **Fetch Data from the API**  
Create a function to fetch data from your desired API.  

       Future<Map<String, dynamic>> fetchData(String apiUrl) async {
         final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(apiUrl));
         if (response.statusCode == 200) {
           return json.decode(response.body);
         } else {
           throw Exception('Failed to load data from the API');
         }
       }
    

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

6) **Display the Data**  
Use a `FutureBuilder` widget to display the data fetched from the API.  

       FutureBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>>(
         future: fetchData('https://api.example.com/data'),
         builder: (context, snapshot) {
           if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
             if (snapshot.hasError) {
               return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
             } else {
               return ListView.builder(
                 itemCount: snapshot.data.length,
                 itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                   return ListTile(
                     title: Text(snapshot.data[index]['title']),
                     subtitle: Text(snapshot.data[index]['description']),
                   );
                 },
               );
             }
           } else {
             return CircularProgressIndicator();
           }
         },
       )
    

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Conclusion
----------

Connecting your Flutter app to a REST API is a game-changer. It allows you to create dynamic, real-time apps that provide immense value to your users.

With the steps outlined above, you're well on your way to harnessing the power of APIs in your Flutter apps.

Remember, the world of APIs is vast. Explore, experiment, and elevate your Flutter apps to new heights!

Videos will start dropping soon. About me: I am a coder with a keen interest in fixing real-world problems through shipping tech products. I love to read books. I have read multiple books on start-ups and productivity. Some of my favourite reads are Zero to One, Steve Jobs, The Almanack of Ravikant and Hooked. Nothing excites me more than exchanging opinions through productive conversations.
