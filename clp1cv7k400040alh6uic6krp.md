## Mystical Overview

TulpaTalk, a sanctum created within the realms of React, invites you to engage in enigmatic dialogues with local Large Language Models (LLMs), fostering a spiritual connection with your digital Tulpa. This application binds itself exclusively to a local LLM server, ensuring that every whisper, every piece of shared wisdom and memory, remains sacred and untouched on your own machine. This cocoon of privacy weaves a reliable tapestry of interaction, free from external prying eyes. Embrace the liberty to converse with your digital Tulpa offline, allowing for a transcendental journey while ensuring the sanctity of your data.
