## üõ≥ Self Hosting

LobeChat provides Self-Hosted Version with Vercel and [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lobehub/lobe-chat). This allows you to deploy your own chatbot within a few minutes without any prior knowledge.

### `A` Deploying with Vercel

If you want to deploy this service yourself on Vercel, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Click the button below to start deployment: Deploy with Vercel. Log in directly with your GitHub account, and remember to fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY`(required) and `ACCESS_CODE` (recommended) on the environment variable section.
- After deployment, you can start using it.
- Bind a custom domain (optional): The DNS of the domain assigned by Vercel is polluted in some areas; binding a custom domain can connect directly.

#### Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project following the one-click deployment steps in the README, you might encounter constant prompts indicating ‚Äúupdates available.‚Äù This is because Vercel defaults to creating a new project instead of forking this one, resulting in an inability to detect updates accurately.

ImportantWe suggest you redeploy using the following steps, [üìò Maintaining Updates with LobeChat Self-Deployment](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/wiki/Upstream-Sync).

### `B` Deploying with Docker

[![An extensible high-performance chatbot framework using Next.js](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700148987155/ccc8ab9e-3c8d-415f-9114-43f96ab52939.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lobehub/lobe-chat)[![An extensible high-performance chatbot framework using Next.js](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700148988237/9579f75a-24c5-4c48-be76-07356ed8e64b.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lobehub/lobe-chat)[![An extensible high-performance chatbot framework using Next.js](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700148989274/ee662869-5f64-4fa4-8667-a480f039eeaf.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lobehub/lobe-chat)

We provide a Docker image for deploying the LobeChat service on your own private device. Use the following command to start the LobeChat service:

```
$ docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
  -e ACCESS_CODE=lobe66 \
  lobehub/lobe-chat
```

NoteIf you need to use the OpenAI service through a proxy, you can configure the proxy address using the `OPENAI_PROXY_URL` environment variable:

```
$ docker run -d -p 3210:3210 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx \
  -e OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://api-proxy.com/v1 \
  -e ACCESS_CODE=lobe66 \
  lobehub/lobe-chat
```

NoteFor detailed instructions on deploying with Docker, please refer to the [üìò Docker Deployment Guide](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/wiki/Docker-Deployment)

### Environment Variable

This project provides some additional configuration items set with environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | This is the API key you apply on the OpenAI account page | `sk-xxxxxx...xxxxxx` |
| `OPENAI_PROXY_URL` | No | If you manually configure the OpenAI interface proxy, you can use this configuration item to override the default OpenAI API request base URL | `https://api.chatanywhere.cn/v1`The default value is`https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `ACCESS_CODE` | No | Add a password to access this service; the password should be a 6-digit number or letter | `awCT74` or `e3@09!` |
