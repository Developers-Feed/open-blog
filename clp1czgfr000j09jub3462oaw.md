### Last Update 5/05/2023

## Description

### What does this app do ?

I always wanted to create piano Tutorials like big youtubers, but I didn‚Äôt want to pay for professional software, so I created it myself :). This app makes it super easy to create piano tutorials, it delivers some basic effects, basic sound, and if you can‚Äôt record a midi file with softwares, you can record it there. Also with recording app gives you basic (super basic) sheet music. On top of that, app gives you plenty of ways to customize effects, colors, spped of playing. With this app you can learn and have fun.

### Technologies used

- **React**
- **Typescript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Sass (scss)**
- **Redux (a little)**
- **NPM library**

### How does the app work ?

1. **User input** User Drags/chooses Midi file. He can configure options before that, or he can play demo file, then the Midi file is automatically imported 
2. **Website proceses it** Website saves the file to localstorage and it procesess it. It uses a ‚Äú/helpers/getNoteEventsJSON.ts‚Äù file (function) to remove all unnecesarry events. 
3. **Website creates canvas animation** Canvas animation is created, frame rate is 60fps or 144 fps (depends on the screen type).
