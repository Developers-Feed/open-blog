Are you tired of sending code snippets back and forth, struggling to debug and collaborate with your team? Look no further! **Sync Code** is here to revolutionize the way you code together. This powerful and intuitive collaborative code editor is designed to empower developers, designers, and teams to work seamlessly in real-time, regardless of their location.

## Features

## Run Locally

This project is not currently live on any server. But to use the demo version, follow the steps below:

- Clone this repository and cd into it
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- To start the server run `yarn server:dev` in another terminal
- Then run `yarn start` to run the application
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app
- To join as an another user open another browser or incognito tab and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Known Bugs

- If a user leaves or enters the room, the toast notification number not showing correctly.
  - Like, if I (user1) creates a room and user2 joins the same room, then instead of one toast notification, four toast notifications are shown.
  - Now if user2 leaves, then two toast notifications are shown instead of one. P.S. The numbers of toast notification increases more and more if more users joins and leaves the room.

**Note:** If you find any other bugs, please let me know. I will try to fix it as soon as possible ðŸ™‚ In case you want to fix it yourself, feel free to make a pull request.

## Future Scope

- Add syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Add support for multiple themes (currently using Dracula theme)
