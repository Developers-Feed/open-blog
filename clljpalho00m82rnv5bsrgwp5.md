Modernizing legacy systems isn‚Äôt just about catching up with the latest and greatest tech; it‚Äôs about staying competitive. Yet, transitioning away from legacy systems can be daunting, especially with the risk of losing valuable data or facing compatibility issues. The effort involved in setting up numerous data models, crafting Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), and coding boilerplate for hundreds of existing tables, not to mention managing intricate relations, can be massive and time-consuming. This is where our latest feature - **DB Schema Import** - steps in, offering an efficient and seamless way to bring your old infrastructure into the modern era without getting lost in the complexities.

Why modernize with Amplication?
-------------------------------

### Rapid Development

Launch your projects faster. Amplication‚Äôs auto-generation tools drastically cut down the development process by handling boilerplate and infrastructure code, saving you months that you'd otherwise spend crafting code for your existing data models.

### Consistency

No more patchwork solutions. Amplication ensures your backend services are consistent, scalable, and up to industry standards.

### Stay in Control

While Amplication streamlines the development process, you retain full ownership and control of your code. It's automation with autonomy.

### Cost Savings

By reducing manual work, the risk of errors and associated costs decrease.

### Efficient Data Integration with the DB Schema Import

Transitioning away from legacy systems doesn‚Äôt mean starting from scratch. With the DB Schema Import feature, you can effortlessly bring in your existing database schema, preserving the value of your legacy data and laying the foundation for new, modern applications.

Getting started with DB Schema Import
-------------------------------------

Ready to upgrade your legacy system? Here's a quick guide:

*   **Generate your Prisma schema**: Use [Prisma's introspection](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/introspection) to scan your legacy database and produce a **`schema.prisma`** file.
*   **Upload to Amplication**: Once your schema is ready, bring it into Amplication, which will automatically set up your entities, fields, and relations.
*   **Pick your Database**: Select either MySQL or PostgreSQL by installing the appropriate DB plugin.
*   **Build & Commit**: Generate and commit the code for your project via Amplication.

**Check out our [step-by-step guide](https://docs.amplication.com/how-to/import-prisma-schema/) for a deeper dive**

A Real-Life Example
-------------------

Let's dive into an example to demonstrate just how effortless it is to create a fully-functional service using this feature. In this walkthrough, we'll leverage a Prisma Schema file to automate the setup of entities, fields, and relations, laying the groundwork for a fully functioning application to manage events.

*   Create a new ‚ÄòEvent Management‚Äô service with Amplication
    *   Make sure to select MySQL or PostgreSQL database during the service creation wizard
