# Comfort Eats: Food Web App (React JS Styled With Tailwind CSS)

## Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies

All of the data/images to simulate API responses are located at src/data/data.js

This was a fun little project consisting of React & Tailwind which is a super powerful frontend combination you can use to quickly build websites. In this build I focused on adding a little extra javascript with the array filter method to filter out specific food types and pricing categories.[![A Food Web App using React JS and Tailwind CSS](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692552055984/25081753-b404-4527-a0b4-84a54b8ef246.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115655242/259903913-6590df08-a9b0-4811-8acb-cfba38e5ca84.png)
